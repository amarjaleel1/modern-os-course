## üìö Core Concepts

### What is an Operating System?

An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages:
- Hardware resources
- Software applications
- User interface

### Key Components

1. **Process Management**
   - Creation and deletion
   - Scheduling and synchronization
   - Inter-process communication

2. **Memory Management**
   - Physical and virtual memory
   - Memory allocation
   - Address translation

3. **File Systems**
   - File organization
   - Storage management
   - Access control

## üî® Hands-on Practice

Try these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check your OS version
uname -a

# View running processes
ps aux

# Check memory usage
free -h
```
